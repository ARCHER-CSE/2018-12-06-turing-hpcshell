# UNIX fundamentals on HPC installations

* SSH to a cluster 
* Bash fundamentals (`cd`, `ls`, ..., aliases, functions, ~/.bashrc)
* Transferring files (`scp`? `sftp`? Maybe only one?), maybe adapt [15-transferring-files.md](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/tree/gh-pages/_episodes/15-transferring-files.md)
* Working with the environment (showing the power of changing `PATH`)
* Introducing modules or similar
