This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems effectively. We
obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course on parallel programming in just two
days of teaching time. Instead, this workshop is intended to give students a good introduction and
overview of the tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

   - Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data
   - Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system
   - Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software
   - Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource

The material for the second part of this workshop is available at: [https://archer-cse.github.io/2018-12-06-turing-hpcintro/](https://archer-cse.github.io/2018-12-06-turing-hpcintro/)
