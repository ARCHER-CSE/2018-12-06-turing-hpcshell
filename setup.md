You must bring a wireless-enabled laptop to the workshop (note: a tablet such as an
iPad is not sufficient).

You will also need to ensure you have a working SSH client and that you have signed 
up for an account on the Cirrus HPC system ahead of the workshop, further instructions
on these are provided below.

Though setup help will be provided at the workshop, 
we recommend that these tools are installed (or at least downloaded) beforehand.

## SSH

All students should have an SSH client installed.
SSH is a tool that allows us to connect to and use a remote computer as our own.
Please follow the directions below to install an SSH client for your system.

**Windows**

Install MobaXterm from [http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).
You will want to get the Home edition (Installer edition).

**macOS**

Although macOS comes with SSH pre-installed, 
you will likely want to install [XQuartz](www.xquartz.org) to enable graphical support.
Note that you must restart your computer to complete the installation.

**Linux**

Linux users do not need to install anything, you should be set!

## Account on Cirrus

Please sign up for your account on our HPC machine, Cirrus, which will be available to
you for the duration of the course and for a few weeks afterwards, to allow you to
complete the practical exercises and put some of what you have learned into practice.

To sign up, you must first register for an account on SAFE (our service administration
web application): https://tier2-safe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/safe-guide-users.html

and then request your Cirrus machine account under project `tc001`: https://tier2-safe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/safe-guide-users.html#tier-2-facilities-accounts-passwords
